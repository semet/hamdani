          I started coding more than 10 years ago when the good old PHP and
          Double-clicking index.html was a thing. I then learned more advance
          languages like HTML (I am one of those who believe HTML is a
          Programming Language itself ðŸ˜‚), CSS, JavsScript, TypeScript, MySql
          and many more. I also spent my time learning some stuffs like Reactjs,
          Vuejs, Nextjs, Nodejs (especially Express), and a good amount of time
          diving Rest API. But my primary Language is Javascript (React/Nextjs)
          and PHP (Laravel) . I know GraphQL a little bit and I keep myself
          Up-to-Date with the information about the languages and technologies
          that I use. I claim myself to be one of those Fullstack Developer
          because I can do Front-end Design, good understanding of Rest API and
          how to connect both. By the way, I also know Laravel very well (incase
          you need a PHP Developer). I currently work in a leading tech company
          called Synergyse Tech. I work full time as Frontend Developer by using
          Nextjs as the main framework.
