                  I started coding more than 10 years ago when the good old PHP and
                  Double-clicking index.html was a thing. I then learned more advance
                  languages like HTML (I am one of those who believe HTML is a
                  Programming Language itself ðŸ˜‚), CSS, JavsScript, TypeScript, MySql
                  and many more. I also spent my time learning some stuffs like
                  Reactjs, Vuejs, Nextjs, Nodejs (especially Express), and a good
                  amount of time diving Rest API. But my primary Language is PHP
                  (Laravel) and Javascript (React/Nextjs). I know GraphQL a little
                  bit and I keep myself Up-to-Date with the information about the
                  languages and technologies that I use. Sadly, up until you read
                  this, I never have my first job as Web Developer and most of my
                  works I open for free in my Github page. I don't know the minimum
                  requirement of a man being a Fullstack Developer but I claim myself
                  to be one of those because I can do Front-end Design, good
                  understanding of Rest API and how to connect both. By the way, I
                  also know Laravel very well (incase you need a PHP Developer).
