                  I started coding more than 10 years ago when the good old PHP and
                  Double-clicking index.html was a thing. I then learned more advance
                  languages like HTML (I am one of those who believe HTML is a
                  Programming Language itself ðŸ˜‚), CSS, JavsScript, TypeScript, MySql
                  and many more. I also spent my time learning some stuffs like
                  Reactjs, Vuejs, Nextjs, Nodejs (especially Express), and a good
                  amount of time diving Rest API. But my primary Language is
                  Javascript (React/Nextjs) and PHP (Laravel) . I know GraphQL a
                  little bit and I keep myself Up-to-Date with the information about
                  the languages and technologies that I use. I claim myself to be one
                  of those Fullstack Developer because I can do Front-end Design,
                  good understanding of Rest API and how to connect both. By the way,
                  I also know Laravel very well (incase you need a PHP Developer).
